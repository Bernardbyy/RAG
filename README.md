# Knowledge Assistant Chatbot 

## Overview

CelcomDigi Knowledge Assistant is an AI-powered RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system designed to provide accurate, context-aware responses to questions about CelcomDigi products and services. This proof-of-concept application demonstrates how AI can efficiently access and leverage information stored within internal documents to deliver intelligent assistance to customer service representatives.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Document Processing**: Automatically extracts and processes information from PDF documents using OCR technology
- **Question-Answer Based Chunking**: Organizes document content by natural question-answer pairs for optimal retrieval
- **Advanced Semantic Search**: Utilizes specialized question-answering embeddings for precise information retrieval
- **Local LLM Integration**: Runs entirely on-premise using Ollama with Qwen3 models
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides responses based on retrieved information with clear source attribution
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, user-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes evaluation tools to measure and improve system performance

## System Architecture
